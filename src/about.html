          <h1 class="single-post__title">Hello and nice to meet you!</h1>
          <div class="single-post__text"><p>I started my blog in December 2009, and back then I had no idea the adventure that lay ahead for me. I wanted another way to communicate with my community, to share my photos in a new medium, and above all, I was looking for a way to have fun.</p>

          <p>How should I introduce myself… “Hello, my name is Elis and I’m a journalist and photographer living in Lisbon, Portugal” would be too simple. Such kind of phrases are good for sidebad information, but are not enough to tell about who I am exactly.</p>

          <p>I started Epiphany as a means of sharing my love for visual treasures — especially in the creative fields of interior design, architecture, food and travel photography. What began as a hobby eventually turned into a full-time passion and part-time job (which i love!)</p>

          <p>I always refer to the owners of anything I feature. However, if you have a problem with your work appearing here let me know and I will remove it. I only feature things I love, though! Hence, I am a fan.</p>

          <p>I write all the posts myself, and I only share things I truly like / love / find exceptional. So you can be rest assured that whatever you see here is a true reflection of my taste, and not something I have been paid to blog about.</p>

          <p>If you really want to understand what I do with my days (even I am not sure), you can go and browse the posts where I talk about the projects that have touched me deeply, most notably, the collaborations that I chose as carefully as I can.</p>

          <p>Oh, and don’t miss out on some of my trips that have altered me to the core, the encounters that have changed me (there are so many it’s impossible to choose), and the incredible CDFA Award that Scott and I got in June of 2012… And then I think you’ll have a little better idea what we’re up to here on the blog.</p>

          <p>From there, you’ll be ready for the post where I write about one of the crazier moments of my life, when I suddenly became Cindy Crawford and started writing for my favorite magazine, Paris Vogue. Yeah, I think that, more than anything explains just how much I had no idea how big of an adventure I was in for when I started the blog in 2006.</p>

          <p>There you have it. If you still want to see me up close and personal (literally), you can watch my dear beloved web-series (pardon my bias, it’s kinda my baby). Pardon My French, one of the projects that I hold closest to my heart as it’s the way I found to keep myself dreaming, and gives me the opportunity to bring you even closer into the whirlwind of fashion, into the conversations, the laughter, and the intimacy that makes this blog what it is.</p>

          <p>You can also find some photos from Corsica, the island I grew up on, and a post that still makes me very emotional , the text that I wrote when my beloved grandmother passed away.</p>

          <p>Okay, enough with the trip down nostalgia lane… Let’s go back to now, to my observations on the city I live in now, New York, and its impossible inhabitants, my ongoing “I have 6 pounds to lose!!!” topic.</p>

          <p>I hope you are going to enjoy it, and you’ll stick with my storytelling for a little while. Or better long one!</p></div>
